# Git Aliases for PowerShell

Simple git aliases for PowerShell inspired by Oh My Zsh, making your git workflow faster and more efficient.

## Features

- üöÄ **Fast git commands** - Short aliases for common git operations
- üîß **Simple setup** - Just copy and paste into your PowerShell profile
- üìù **Oh My Zsh inspired** - Familiar aliases for Zsh users
- ü™ü **Windows friendly** - Works seamlessly with PowerShell

## Installation

### Simple Copy & Paste Setup

1. **Open your PowerShell profile for editing**:
   ```powershell
   notepad $PROFILE
   ```

   **üí° Helpful hints:**
   - If the file doesn't exist, PowerShell will ask if you want to create it - click "Yes"
   - You can also use VS Code: `code $PROFILE`
   - To see where your profile is located: `echo $PROFILE`
   - Common locations:
     - Windows PowerShell 5.1: `Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
     - PowerShell 7+: `Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

2. **Copy the aliases**: Open [`git-aliases.md`](git-aliases.md) and copy all the PowerShell code from the "PowerShell Code" section

3. **Paste into your profile**: Paste the copied code at the end of your PowerShell profile file

4. **Save and reload**: Save the file and restart PowerShell or run:
   ```powershell
   . $PROFILE
   ```

That's it! All git aliases are now available in your PowerShell sessions.
